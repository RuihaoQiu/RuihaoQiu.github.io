## About me
My name is Ruihao QIU, a physicist and data scientist. 

I got a joint Ph.D in statistical physics and materials science, between France and Belgium. 

During my PhD, I used different numerical techniques (machine learning, atomic simulations, statistical modeling, finite element method etc.) to solve problems in physics, chemistry, materials science and even in geography. 

I like both team working and deep working alone. I enjoy understanding profoundly and  using/creating new tools to tackle different challenges.
