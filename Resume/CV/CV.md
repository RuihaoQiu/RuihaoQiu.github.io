#### **EXPERIENCES**

- Doctoral Researcher - ICMCB, CNRS, France,  10. 2014 - 02. 2018
  - Applied machine learning algorithms (random forest, gradient boosting etc.) on materials classification and regression, based on relevant properties from various data sources.
  - Built a database on various materials properties from atomic simulations, by employing andcrafting complex optimization algorithms for distributed computing on hundreds of CPUs.
  - Managed an international research project for searching and designing new multiferroicmaterials, accomplished with 4 presentations in international conferences and 3 publicationsin high impact journals.
- Doctoral Researcher - CESAM, University of Liège, Belgium,  10. 2015 - 03. 2017
  - Built practical statistical models by Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (implementing Metropoli-Hasting algorithm), for simulation of the magnetic phase transition.
  - Developed an automatic data pipeline for a geographic project, implemented the logisticregression by R – largely accelerated and contributed to the PhD thesis of Dr. Nick Estrada.
  - Applied deep learning (CNN) to determine and predict the mass of galaxies, with 100,000images of galaxy on GPUs (Astrohack).
- Research Assistant - Chinese Academy of Sciences, China 09. 2012 - 07. 2014-
  - Applied valence bond method and simple machine learning techniques to identify the potential environment-friendly Lead-free materials based on experimental dataset.
