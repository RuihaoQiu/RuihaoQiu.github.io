## About me
My name is Ruihao QIU,  a physicist and data scientist. I got a Ph.D on statistical physics and materials science. 

During my academic experience, I used statistical modeling and machine learning methods to solve problems on physics and materials science. With six years of research training in science, I had a solid background on statistics and programming. I found what I have acquired from academic research can be easily applied to solve more interesting and challenging problems in the industrial world.
