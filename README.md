## About me
My name is Ruihao QIU, a physicist and data scientist. I got a joint Ph.D in statistical physics and materials science, between France and Belgium. 

During my PhD, I used different numerical techniques, such as atomic simulations, statistical modeling, machine learning, finite element method etc., to solve problems in physics, chemistry, materials science and even in geography. 

I like both team working and deep working alone. I enjoy understanding profoundly and  using/creating new tools to confront the different challenges. 

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

With the growth mindset, I believe most of the goals can be achieved by continuously learning and practicing.

The followings are my profiles, and then the projects I have accomplished —

## Data Science Projects 
- #### [**Searching for Novel Materials by Machine Learning**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ruihaoqiu/Machine-learning-on-materials-research/tree/master/)

  #### a. materials filter

  Build unsupervised learning models (K-mean clustering) to identify the fake materials. We computed the phonon spectrum of a group of materials, which can be used as the input features. Without labeling them, our model is able to cluster them into two groups — real and fake materials. Therefore, before experiments, we can use this model to check whether the candidates can be synthesized or not.

  #### b. materials classification.

  Use material properties (structural and electrical properties) from both experiments and simulations as the input features. Apply several classifiers (SVM, random forest, gradient boosting tree etc.) to separate ferroelectrics and nonferroelectrics, in order to search for new ferroelectrics for potential applications. 

  #### c. predict material properties

  Predict specific properties - bandgap and formation energy, based on the data from simulations (mainly structural parameters).

  Apply machine learning algorithms on materials classification, aimed to search for new lead-free piezoelectric materials.

- #### [**Monte Carlo Simulation on Magnetic Phase Transition**](https://ruihaoqiu.github.io/MC-Magnetic-Phase-Transition/)

  Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to simulate magnetic phase transition procedure.


- #### [**Landslide in Guatemala**](http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/212996)

  Prediction of landslide map in Guatemala with R. In collaboration with Nick Estrada on his PhD project of geography
