## About me
My name is Ruihao QIU, a physicist and data scientist. I got a joint Ph.D in statistical physics and materials science, between France and Belgium. 

During my PhD, I used different numerical techniques, such as atomic modeling, statistical modeling, machine learning, finite element method etc., to solve problems in physics, chemistry, materials science and even geography. 

I like both team working and deep working alone. I enjoy understanding and then use/create new tools to confront the challenges by quick learning and adapting.

> What I cannot create, I do not understand.

The followings are my profiles, and then the projects I have accomplished —

## Projects on Data Science 
- [**Monte Carlo Simulation on Magnetic Phase Transition**](https://ruihaoqiu.github.io/MC-Magnetic-Phase-Transition/)

  Use Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to simulate magnetic phase transition procedure.

- [**Searching for Novel Materials by Machine Learning**](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/RuihaoQiu/Materials-Classification-by-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Materials_classificaton.ipynb)

  Apply machine learning algorithms on materials classification, aimed to search for new lead-free piezoelectric materials.

- [**Landslide in Guatemala**](http://orbi.ulg.ac.be/handle/2268/212996)

  Prediction of landslide map in Guatemala with R. In collaboration with Nick Estrada on his PhD project of geography
