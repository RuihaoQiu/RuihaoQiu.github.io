### Algorithms

------

Implement the most important algorithms for machine learning and searching from scratch.



**Machine learning**:

- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)

- Naive Bayes

- Decision tree

- Random forest

- Adaboost

- Gradient boosting

- Linear regression

- Logistic regression

- Neural network

  ​

**Others**

- Search algorithms
- Sorting algorithms
- Graph search algorithm

(to be continued … )
